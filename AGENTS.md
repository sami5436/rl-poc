# AGENTS Instructions

This repository aims to build an educational Jupyter notebook that is broken into clear blocks. Each block should contain a focused segment of code accompanied by descriptive commentary so readers can follow along step-by-step.

## Guidelines
- Store notebooks at the root of the repository.
- Start with a simple reinforcement learning example using the classic CartPole environment.
- Organize the notebook into sequential sections: environment setup, defining the agent, training loop, and evaluation.
- Precede each code cell with a Markdown cell explaining the intent of the upcoming code.
- Favor readability and clarity over compactness.

## Testing
Run `pytest` before committing, even if no tests are present, to ensure the test suite executes without errors.
